        <p class="fade-in">
        Global warming refers specifically to the rise in Earth's average temperature
        due to increased greenhouse gases such as carbon dioxide. It mainly focuses
        on the warming of the planet.
        </p>

        <p class="fade-in">
        Climate change is a broader term that includes global warming but also
        covers long-term changes in rainfall, storms, sea levels, and weather patterns.
        </p>

        <p class="fade-in">
        In simple words, global warming is the temperature increase,
        while climate change includes all the environmental changes
        caused because of that warming.
