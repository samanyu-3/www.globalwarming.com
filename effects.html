        <p>
        One of the most visible effects of global warming is the melting of glaciers and polar ice caps.
        This leads to rising sea levels, which threaten coastal cities and island nations.

        <p>
        Extreme weather events such as heatwaves, heavy rainfall, floods, droughts, and cyclones
        are becoming more frequent and intense due to climate change.
        </p>

        <p>
        Global warming also affects biodiversity. Many plant and animal species struggle to adapt
        to changing temperatures, leading to habitat loss and possible extinction.
        It also impacts agriculture and food production worldwide.
