        Scientific studies show that the Earth's temperature has increased
        by approximately 1°C over the last century. Carbon dioxide levels
        are now at their highest in about 800,000 years.

        Glaciers across the world are shrinking rapidly,
        and sea levels are rising due to melting ice.
