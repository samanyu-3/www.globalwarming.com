Global warming is not a distant problem. It is happening now.
Every rising temperature, every melting glacier, and every extreme weather event
is a warning sign from our planet.

But there is hope. If governments, communities, and individuals work together,
we can slow down climate change and protect Earth for future generations.

        <p>class="fade-in"
        Reducing global warming requires collective effort from individuals, governments,
        and organisations. One important step is switching to renewable energy sources
        such as solar, wind, and hydro power.
        </p>

        <p>class="fade-in"
        Planting more trees and protecting forests help absorb carbon dioxide and improve air quality.
        Energy conservation, using public transport, and reducing plastic usage are simple steps
        individuals can take.
        </p>

        <p>class="fade-in"
        By spreading awareness and adopting sustainable practices, we can slow down climate change
        and protect our planet for future generations.
