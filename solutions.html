        <p>
        Reducing global warming requires collective effort from individuals, governments,
        and organisations. One important step is switching to renewable energy sources
        such as solar, wind, and hydro power.
        </p>

        <p>
        Planting more trees and protecting forests help absorb carbon dioxide and improve air quality.
        Energy conservation, using public transport, and reducing plastic usage are simple steps
        individuals can take.
        </p>

        <p>
        By spreading awareness and adopting sustainable practices, we can slow down climate change
        and protect our planet for future generations.
