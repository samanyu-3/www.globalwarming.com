        <h2>🌍 Why This Matters To Me</h2>

<p>
As a student, I believe protecting our planet is our responsibility.
Global warming is not just a scientific issue; it affects our daily lives.
The decisions we make today will shape the future of our generation.
By spreading awareness and taking small actions, we can create a healthier planet.
